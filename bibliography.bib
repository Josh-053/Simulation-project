Abstract = {The dose proportionality of cisatracurium pharmacokinetics was assessed using a population approach by incorporating the collection of sparse blood samples from patients in clinical trials. Plasma concentration—time data from 131 patients with limited concentration—time data and 38 patients with full sampling were pooled and analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM). Dose proportionality was assessed using dichotomous parameterization and a linear model. The population pharmacokinetic approach revealed that the pharmacokinetics of cisatracurium are independent of dose between 0.1 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg, as was expected based on the importance of Hofmann elimination, a chemical process dependent on pH and temperature.},
