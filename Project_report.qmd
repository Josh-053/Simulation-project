## Introduction

Brontogen fibropathy (BF) is an inherited disorder that leads to changes in lung tissue and airflow over time. Patients with BF develop infection from *Spirgilus viridicaulis*, a fungal species that grows in warm and humid regions. This fungus can be treated using the antimycotic drug triazoconazole. This drug is administered to children with BF for off-label use, as it is originally indicated for patients with bronchiectasis.

## Objectives

The purpose of the simulation was to evaluate whether the administered dose of 150 mg once a day evoked sufficient exposure with area under the curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC~0-24~) of 28 mg·h/L for children with Brontogen fibropathy. The goal was also to suggest an optimal dosing regimen based on the simulation results.

## Methods

A study of 33 adolescent patients was simulated over 100 replicates, resulting in a total of 3300 simulated patients. The simulation was performed using `mrgsolve` package in `R`. A dosing event was created for the administered regimen of **150 mg q24h**, which was used to simulate the individual predicted plasma concentration-time profile (IPRED) and the cumulative area under the curve (cAUC). AUC~0-24~ was calculated using the **continuous AUC integration** method of adding cAUC from 0 to 24 hours. Five empirical dosing regimens were simulated in the same manner as the administered regimen, these were as follows: **150 mg q8h, 150 mg q12h, 240 mg q24h, 300 mg q24h and 330 mg q24h**. Higher doses were selected based on the assumption of dose proportionality @certaradoseprop. The probability of target attainment (PTA, %) was calculated for all regimens, with the target AUC~0-24~ set at **28 mg·h/L**. The target PTA was set at 90% @sheng2010. The next page shows the simulation model script.

The table below (@tbl-AUC) demonstrates the tested dosing regimens, along with their summary statistics for AUC~0-24~, as well as the probability of target attainment (PTA, %). The target AUC~0-24~ was **28 mg·h/L**. The dosing regimen of interest (**150 mg q24h**) elicits an AUC~0-24~ of `r signif(median(auc_all$AUC_0_24[auc_all$regimen=="150 mg q24h"], digits = 4))` mg·h/L, which corresponds to a PTA of zero percent. Regimens **150 mg q12h and 240 mg q24h** have a PTA below 90%, whereas regimens **150 mg q8h, 300 mg q24h and 330 mg q24h** have a PTA of at least 90%.

## Discussion

In this study, a model was used for the simulation of regimens for dose optimizations of triazoconazole in children with Brontogen fibropathy (BF). As seen in @tbl-AUC, the PTA was zero percent for dosing regimen of **150 mg q24h**. This means that none of the virtual patients evoked sufficient exposure. Increasing the dose led to an increase in exposure, while the same effect was achieved from reducing the inter-dose interval. However, administering the dose more frequently might lead to reduced patient compliance. Therefore, regimens **300 or 330 mg q24h** were regarded as suitable dosing regimens.

There were limitations in the study: due to limited data on response and toxicity profile, the safety of the dosing regimens of triazoconazole could not be assessed. Furthermore, no exposure-response relationship could be established. Once sufficient response and toxicity data are available, the safety of the proposed dosing regimens will be evaluated, and exposure-response analysis will be carried out.

## Conclusion

The study suggests that the dosing regimen of **150 mg q24h** proposed by Dr. Tagore, elicits an insufficient exposure. Dosing regimens of **300 and 330 mg q24h** are proposed and expected to achieve the target exposure and elicit optimal response against *S. viridicaulis* in children with Brontogen fibropathy.
